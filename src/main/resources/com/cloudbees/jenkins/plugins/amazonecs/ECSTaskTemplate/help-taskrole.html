    AWS IAM Role to associate with the ECS Agent Task to grant permissions to access other AWS resources.
</p>
<p>
    If your agent needs access to other AWS resources, you can create a role with appropriate policies and associate
    that role with the agent ECS Task.
</p>
<p>
    All containers within a task have access to all permissions defined in the instance profile of the container instances.
    It is recommended to limit the permissions of container instances and specify service specific permissions at the
    task level.
